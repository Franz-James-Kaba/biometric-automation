AI-Enhanced Test Automation Suite for BioAuth Login System

üìñ Overview
This project implements a sophisticated AI-enhanced test automation suite for a simulated mobile login application that supports both traditional username/password and biometric authentication (Fingerprint & Face ID). The suite is designed to rigorously test the application's functionality, reliability, and user experience under various conditions, leveraging AI to elevate the testing strategy beyond traditional methods.

The System Under Test (SUT) is a demo Android application (app-debug.apk) featuring:

Username/Password Login
Simulated Fingerprint Authentication
Simulated Face ID Authentication (via the same Android biometric prompt)
A backend that simulates authentication logic via REST endpoints.

üß† AI Integration & Strategy
Our approach integrates AI across the testing lifecycle to improve efficiency, coverage, and insight.

AI Application	Tool Used	Implementation Details
Test Case Generation	ChatGPT (OpenAI API)	Used a structured prompt to generate a comprehensive set of Gherkin-style scenarios covering success, failure, fallback, lockout, and edge cases. This ensured we didn't miss critical user journeys.
Test Script Writing	ChatGPT & GitHub Copilot	Accelerated the creation of boilerplate code (Page Object Models, helper functions) and complex Appium interactions by describing the intent in natural language.
Visual Anomaly Detection	Applitools Eyes	Integrated into the Appium framework. Each test that lands on a screen (login, success, error) performs a visual AI checkpoint. This detects UI regressions like layout shifts, color changes, and missing elements that traditional locators would miss.
Predictive Failure Analysis	Custom Heuristic Analysis	A post-test script analyzes logs and test results. It flags tests that show increasing execution time or flakiness, predicting potential future failures due to performance degradation or element instability.

üöÄ How to Run the Tests
Prerequisites
Java JDK 11+

Android SDK with adb in your system PATH.

Appium Server 2.0+ (Can be run via Docker, as shown below).

An Android Emulator (API 28+ recommended) created with a Fingerprint sensor.

Enroll a Fingerprint in your emulator:

Go to Settings -> Security -> Fingerprint.

Set a PIN.

Enroll a fingerprint by running this command 10-15 times:

bash
adb -e emu finger touch 1
Get an Applitools API Key (optional for core tests, needed for visual AI):

Create a free account at applitools.com.

Find your API key in the dashboard.

Place it in src/test/resources/applitools-api-key.txt.

Installation & Execution
Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended for Consistency)

Clone the repository and navigate to its root directory.

Start the Appium server:

bash
docker-compose up -d appium
Start your Android emulator.

Run the tests:

bash
# Run all tests
mvn clean test

# Run a specific test group (e.g., biometric tests)
mvn clean test -Dgroups="bioauth"
Option 2: Using a Locally Installed Appium Server

Ensure Appium is installed (npm install -g appium) and running on http://127.0.0.1:4723.

Start your Android emulator.

Run mvn clean test.

Viewing Results
Test Reports: HTML reports are generated in the test-output/ directory. Open emailable-report.html or index.html for detailed results.

Visual AI Dashboard: If using Applitools, test results with screenshots and comparisons are available on your personal Applitools dashboard.

üß™ Detailed Test Scenarios (Sample)
The suite automates complex user flows, such as:

Scenario: LOCK-001 - Account Lockout after Multiple Failed Attempts

Launch app.

Tap "Login with Fingerprint".

AI Action: Appium sends 3 adb emu finger touch 999 commands to simulate failed attempts.

Verify: The UI displays a lockout message.

Visual AI: Applitools verifies the lockout screen is pixel-perfect.

Attempting biometric auth again is disabled.

Scenario: NET-001 - Network Interruption During Authentication

Launch app.

Tap "Login with Fingerprint".

AI Action: A utility method uses adb shell svc wifi disable to kill network after the prompt is shown but before touching the sensor.

Simulate a successful fingerprint touch (adb emu finger touch 1).

Verify: The app displays a user-friendly "Network Error" message and allows retry.

Visual AI: Applitools verifies the error state UI.
